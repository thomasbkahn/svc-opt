# svc-opt
Tools for scanning for optimal support vector machine classifier parameters

## Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- bokeh
- numpy
- tqdm

## Usage
Scanning and plotting are accessed through an objected-oriented API, which is demonstrated in `demo.ipynb`.

## Future Plans
1. Generalize for other kernel types, and eventually for other kinds of classifiers.
2. Add regression analysis to calculate the optimal parameters at each level.
3. Automate the iterative "zooming in" process.
